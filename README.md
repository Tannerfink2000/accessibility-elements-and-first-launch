# first-week

## This week our challenge was to make a website template have the correct html elements and make it accessible

### I accomplished this task by adding the best elements for the situation and adding alternate written out options for the pictures on the website

### I also created a repository that contains my code. FRom GitHub I launched my URL to make it live.
